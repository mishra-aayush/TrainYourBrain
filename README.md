## Usage Instructions
Train Your Brain is a fun game that enhances your algebraic abilities by making you add numbers very quickly in a limited period of time. As soon as you click on the "Let's Go!" Button, you will have 30 seconds to answer the questions. Try to answer all the questions correctly and quickly.

## What I Learned
As this was my first official Android app, it took a good deal of time to set up Android Studio and become acclimated to Android development in general. I ran into numberous issues associated with using Android for the first time.
But after getting over those issues, when I was completely familiar with Android Studio, I learnt and implemented the concepts of timer, random number generator and visibilty of elements on the screen.

## Running Requirements
Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or greater
